/**
 * Pre-built ICP Personas
 *
 * Derived from the ICP-and-Content-Writing doc (Chris Do framework).
 * These are research-backed, high-budget buyer archetypes that serve as:
 *
 * 1. Reference personas — the ICP analyzer can compare a generated profile against these
 *    to enrich missing psychographic fields.
 * 2. Direct targeting — a page can pin one or more personas to guide both
 *    Twitter engagement and content generation without needing historical posts.
 * 3. Content strategy seeds — pick personas when setting up a new page so the
 *    system writes with psychographic precision from day one.
 *
 * Each persona conforms to a subset of ICPProfile that covers the psychographic,
 * hunger, and empathy layers — the fields the base AI analysis sometimes misses.
