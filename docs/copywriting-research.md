# High-Converting Social Media Copywriting Research

## Purpose
This document compiles research from top copywriting sources to optimize AI-generated posts for:
1. **Engagement** (followers, likes, comments, shares)
2. **Traffic** (clicks to website, conversions)

---

## CORE FORMULAS

### 1. PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
The most proven copywriting formula in history.

**Structure:**
- **Problem**: Identify a problem your audience faces
- **Agitate**: Make them feel the pain, emphasize consequences
- **Solve**: Present your solution/insight

**Example for social media:**
```
Tired of girls not looking at you? (Problem)
You're not alone. Thousands try everything - v-neck t-shirts, motorcycles, short shorts. 
At the end of the day, you just want someone to notice you. But that won't happen 
unless you do something about it... (Agitate)
Like learn how to tame a grizzly bear. With your bare hands. (Solve - with intrigue)
```

**Key insight**: Don't reveal what the problem IS immediately. Talk about the CONSEQUENCES first.

### 2. AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
Classic marketing funnel applied to content.

**Structure:**
- **Attention**: Grab focus (hook)
- **Interest**: Keep them engaged (story/context)
- **Desire**: Make them want what you offer (benefits/transformation)
- **Action**: Guide to next step (CTA)

**Example (Duolingo ad):**
- Attention: Giant owl doing trending dance
- Interest: "Learn a language in 5 minutes a day"
- Desire: Comments filled with successful learners
- Action: "Download Now"

### 3. The Curiosity Loop
Keep readers asking "what happens next?"

**How it works:**
1. Raise a question in the reader's mind
2. Build tension by NOT answering immediately
3. Give a "mini-payoff" (partial answer)
4. Immediately raise the NEXT question
5. Repeat until CTA

**Example from Neil Patel:**
```
There is going to be a rude awakening for marketers. (Question: What?)
[Builds tension with context]
The rude awakening is: AI content won't rank. (Mini-payoff)
But here's what will work instead... (New question: What?)
```

## PROVEN HOOK FORMULAS

### Formula #1: Story Opening
`[Past time] I was [mundane action] when [something happened]`

**Example:**
"Last week I was bicycling and this super..." 

**Why it works:** Sets up a story. Stories are naturally interesting.

---

### Formula #2: Contrarian Statement
`Everyone is doing [X] but [reason it doesn't work]`

**Example:**
"Everyone is creating AI content, but very few are getting results."

**Why it works:** Challenges status quo. Makes readers defend or agree.

---

### Formula #3: Transformation Case Study
`This [person] went from [before metric] to [after metric] in [timeframe]. Here's how:`

**Example:**
"This YouTuber went from 1,000 to 100,000 subscribers in 6 months. Here's how:"

**Why it works:** Specific numbers create believability. Implies you can do it too.

---

### Formula #4: Trending Topic Hook
`A [use case of trending topic] that nobody else is talking about`

**Example:**
"A really intriguing use of ChatGPT for marketers that nobody else is talking about"

**Why it works:** Trending topic = immediate relevance. "Nobody else" = exclusive value.

---

### Formula #5: Desirability + But
`Lots of people would gladly [do something desirable] but...`

**Example:**
"Lots of people would gladly switch bank accounts, but..."

**Why it works:** Opens a curiosity gap. They need to know the "but."

---

### Formula #6: Hidden Story Reveal
`Yesterday I was reading about an entrepreneur...`

**Example:**
"Yesterday I was reading about an entrepreneur. His story is incredible:"

**Why it works:** 
- Word "story" signals entertainment value
- Colon at end signals "continue reading"
- Doesn't reveal who immediately (builds anticipation)

---

## WHAT MAKES VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT

### 1. Personal Stories Over Statistics
- Stories from personal experience are most compelling
- Case studies work if presented as stories (problem → climax → resolution)
- Even OTHER people's stories work (e.g., Jon Davids grew 60k followers sharing entrepreneur stories)

### 2. Vulnerability Drives Engagement
**Example from Melissa Kwan:**
"This is the story of my darkest entrepreneur moment..."
- Simple hook, but emotionally charged
- Vulnerability creates relatability
- Most people are succeeding on social media - standing out means sharing struggles

### 3. Question > Answer Framework
Instead of telling lessons directly:
- Raise a question in the reader's mind
- Let them guess the answer
- Then reveal

**Bad:** "Here are three things I learned from the founder of Slack."
**Good:** "Yesterday I read about an entrepreneur who did something most founders would never do. His story is incredible..."

### 4. Mini-Payoffs + Immediate Next Hook
The moment you give an answer, raise the next question.

**Example flow:**
- "Paramount agrees to pick up the show. It's called Yellowstone." (Payoff)
- "And Taylor's gonna blow it up." (Immediately: HOW?)

## PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS

### 1. Specificity = Believability
Generic: "We helped companies save money"
Specific: "We saved a 3-person fintech startup $40k in 6 weeks"

Numbers, timelines, and details make claims believable.

### 2. Social Proof Through Stories
Instead of "Join 10,000 happy customers":
- Share a specific customer story with transformation
- Include quotes
- Show before/after

### 3. Emotional Words That Convert
Research shows these words spark action:
- Discover, Exclusive, Secret, Hidden
- Free, New, Now, Instant
- Proven, Results, Guaranteed
- You, Your (personalization)

### 4. The Gap Technique
Show the gap between:
- Where they ARE now (painful)
- Where they COULD BE (desirable)

Then position your insight/offer as the bridge.

## STRUCTURE FOR SOCIAL POSTS

### Optimal Layout
1. **Short sentences** - Easy to read while scrolling
2. **Line breaks** - Create visual breathing room
3. **No walls of text** - Break up every 1-2 sentences
4. **Emotionally charged first line** - Make them click "see more"
5. **Images** - Take up more screen real estate, force attention

### Character Limits by Platform
- Twitter: 280 chars (aim for ~90 for shareability)
- LinkedIn: 3,000 chars (but hook must be in first 210)
- Facebook: 63,206 chars (but keep under 500 for engagement)

### The "See More" Psychology
On LinkedIn/Facebook, only first 210 chars show.
**YOUR ENTIRE HOOK MUST FIT IN 210 CHARACTERS.**

If readers don't click "see more," your content is invisible.

---

## CALLS-TO-ACTION

### Generic CTAs (Bad)
- "Learn more"
- "Click here"
- "Sign up"

### Specific CTAs (Good)
- "Start your fitness journey today" (202% better than generic)
- "Discover time-saving features in your free demo"
- "See results in 24 hours with your free trial"

### Best CTA Principles
1. Specific about what they'll get
2. Time-bound when possible
3. Value-focused, not action-focused

---

## CONTENT TYPES THAT PERFORM

### For Engagement (Followers)
1. Personal stories of struggle/success
2. Contrarian takes that spark debate
3. Question posts that invite stories
4. Before/after transformations
5. "Drop X in the comments and I'll..." posts

### For Traffic (Conversions)
1. Problem-Agitate-Solve with CTA
2. Case studies with specific results
3. How-to threads with "full guide in bio"
4. Transformation stories with "how" link
5. Limited-time offers with urgency

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR AI PROMPTS

### The AI Must:
1. **Start with STORY, not statistic** - "Last Friday I..." not "87% of..."
2. **Invent SPECIFIC details** - Numbers, timelines, technologies, outcomes
3. **Use curiosity loops** - Raise question → delay answer → mini-payoff → new question
4. **Include ONE strong opinion** - Not wishy-washy "it depends"
5. **End with question that invites THEIR story** - Not "thoughts?"
6. **Follow PAS structure** - Problem → Agitation → Solution/Insight
7. **Keep hooks under 210 chars** - For "see more" click
8. **Use emotional trigger words** - Discover, hidden, secret, proven, results

### The AI Must Avoid:
1. Generic observations without stories
2. Starting with statistics (sounds like marketing)
3. Corporate buzzwords
4. Multiple ideas in one post
5. Weak endings ("What do you think?")
6. Walls of text without line breaks
7. Empty claims without specifics

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

These principles will be encoded in:
1. `lib/openai.ts` - System prompts for content generation
2. `lib/learning/ai-content-reviewer.ts` - Quality scoring criteria

The goal is posts that:
- Stop the scroll (hook)
- Keep reading (curiosity loops)
- Feel authentic (stories + specifics)
- Drive action (strong CTA + clear value)
