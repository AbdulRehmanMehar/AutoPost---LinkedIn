## Implementing These Insights

The `stats-reviewer.ts` service implements all of this research:

1. **`analyzePostMetrics()`**: Interprets each metric with platform-specific context
2. **`detectEngagementPatterns()`**: Identifies success/failure patterns
3. **`generateLearningPrompt()`**: Creates AI-friendly summaries of what worked/didn't
4. **`getPlatformMetricGuide()`**: Returns platform-specific guidance for content creation

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { analyzePostMetrics, generateLearningPrompt } from './lib/learning/stats-reviewer';

const analysis = analyzePostMetrics('linkedin', {
  impressions: 5000,
  likes: 150,
  comments: 45,
  shares: 20,
  clicks: 30,
  engagementRate: 4.9,
});

// Get AI-friendly summary
const learningPrompt = generateLearningPrompt(analysis);

// Detected patterns and insights
console.log(analysis.patterns);
console.log(analysis.keyInsights);
console.log(analysis.recommendations);
```
